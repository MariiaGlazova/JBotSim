# Input files for Graph6 test-suite

Files `graphs.g6` and `digraphs.d6` contain graphs extracted from files obtained from 
[webpage of Brendan McKay](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data). 

Files `graphs-with-header.g6` and `digraphs-with-header.d6` are just the same graphs than in
`graphs.g6` and `digraphs.d6`, but input strings are prefixed with the header corresponding to 
the file format.

Note: Currently `digraphs.d6` contains only one graph (the one given in the documentation of the Graph6 format). 
Unfortunately, up to now, we haven't found existing files using digraph6 format.
