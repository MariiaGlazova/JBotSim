# Applications submodule

This submodule regroups various submodules generating executable used as tests or samples for the `lib` submodule.

If you need to add a new set of examples, this is the place to look.

## Project structure
The submodules are listed below:
* [`examples`](./examples/README.md): Collection of examples using JBotSim.
This contains the former set of samples demonstrating JBotSim usage. 
* [`test-classes`](./test-classes/README.md): Collection of Main classes for several jbotsim/jbotsimx classes.
`lib:jbotsim*` modules' test classes have been moved here.
